This is a small project I've build as a technical cofounder, that is for finding a part time jobs. 

[Demo](https://chures.net/)

I used Next.js, Tailwin, Shadcn/ui and Supabase

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm install & npm run dev 
# or
pnpm install & pnpm dev
```
